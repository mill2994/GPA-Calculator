    This is a GPA calculator that allows you to manually input the
    GPA acquired. I made this because I saw many calculators that
    allowed you to use letter grades, or manually input a GPA, but
    only for your overall and then new classes would have to be
    in the letter grade format. I also wanted to be able to calculate
    GPA needed in the remaining classes in order to get a certain overall,
    particularly to check for honors. I also just wanted to create something
    with my new php skills.
